# Data Visualization 2020
In 2020, I made the goal (not resolution) to re-explore/learn things for the sake of learning, so I am challenging myself to complete one data visualization a week! Here is to getting better at `ggplot`!

<b>First Week (01/26/2020 - 02/01/2020)</b>
- An exploration of the U.C. Cliometric Data focused specifically on U.C. Berkeley
- Note: Learned about `patchwork` for this dataviz and wow I love her.
