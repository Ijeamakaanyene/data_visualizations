# Data Visualization 2020 Goal
In 2020, I made the goal (not resolution) to re-explore/learn things for the sake of learning, so I am challenging myself to complete one data visualization a week! Here is to getting better at `ggplot`!

First Week (01/26/2020 - 02/01/2020)
An exploration of the U.C. Cliometric Data focused specifically on U.C. Berkeley
Note: Learned about `patchwork` for this dataviz and wow I love her.
