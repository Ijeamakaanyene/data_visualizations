# Data Visualization 2020
In 2020, I made the goal (not resolution) to re-explore/learn things for the sake of learning, so I am challenging myself to complete one data visualization a week! Here is to getting better at `ggplot`!

<b>First Week (01/26/2020 - 02/01/2020)</b><br>
An exploration of the U.C. Cliometric Data focused specifically on U.C. Berkeley.<br> 
<i>Note:</i> Learned about `patchwork` for this dataviz and wow I love her.</br>

<b> First Week (Again) (01/26/2020 - 02/01/2020)</b><br>
A TidyTuesday project from the R4DS community. </br>
<i>Note:</i> For this visualization I wanted to better understand `theme()`, so I modified all the elements instead of using one of ggplot's pre-created themes.</br>

<b> Second Week (02/02/2020 - 02/08/2020)</b><br>
A TidyTuesday project from the R4DS community. </br>
This visualization used the NFL Pro Football Reference data in order to explore home field advantage (Is this a thing in football? Unclear!) </br>

</br></br>

<b> Third Week (02/09/2020 - 02/15/2020)</b><br>
A TidyTuesday project from the R4DS community. </br>
This visualization used the an open hotel booking demand dataset from Antonio, Almeida and Nunes, 2019 to see when are the off-seasons and peak-seasons for hotel reservation.</br></br>

</br></br>

<b> Fourth Week (02/16/2020 - 02/22/2020)</b><br>
Another TidyTuesday project from the R4DS community! </br>
This visualization used webscrapped data on food consumption and associated CO2 emissions globally</br></br>
