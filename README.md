# Data Visualization 2020
In 2020, I made the goal (not resolution) to re-explore/learn things for the sake of learning, so I am challenged myself to create one data visualization a week. This ended up being a bit too ambituous, and now it is as I get inspired. Here is to getting better at `ggplot`!

<b> Dates: 05/03/2020 - 05/09/2020</b><br>
A TidyTuesday project for a calendar of Animal Crossing personality types. This used the VillagerDB data.</br></br>

</br></br>

<b> Dates: 03/01/2020 - 03/07/2020</b><br>
For the month of March, I decided that on weeks where I want do not want to explore a new dataset, I can instead revist old visualizations and try to improve them! For this week - I revisied my NFL home field advantage data viz - to see if I can improve conveying the message of the lack of home field advantage. I think I did a pretty good job!</br>
This visualization used the NFL Pro Football Reference data in order to explore home field advantage</br></br>

</br></br>

<b> Dates: 02/23/2020 - 02/29/2020</b><br>
Unsurprisingly, another TidyTuesday project from the R4DS community! Soon my schedule will free up and I can explore other datasets</br>
This visualization used data collected for an article by the WallStreet Journal on measles outbreaks.</br></br>

<b> Dates: 02/16/2020 - 02/22/2020</b><br>
Another TidyTuesday project from the R4DS community! </br>
This visualization used webscrapped data on food consumption and associated CO2 emissions globally</br></br>

<b> Dates: 02/09/2020 - 02/15/2020</b><br>

This visualization used the an open hotel booking demand dataset from Antonio, Almeida and Nunes, 2019 to see when are the off-seasons and peak-seasons for hotel reservation.</br></br>

This visualization used the NFL Pro Football Reference data in order to explore home field advantage (Is this a thing in football? Unclear!) </br>

<i>Note:</i> For this visualization I wanted to better understand `theme()`, so I modified all the elements instead of using one of ggplot's pre-created themes.</br>

<b> Dates: 01/26/2020 - 02/01/2020</b><br>
An exploration of the U.C. Cliometric Data focused specifically on U.C. Berkeley.<br> 
<i>Note:</i> Learned about `patchwork` for this dataviz and wow I love her.</br>
